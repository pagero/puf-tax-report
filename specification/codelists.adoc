Certain elements require the use of PUF specific code list/s. 

Below you will find the lists and where the lists are applicable.

In some of these code lists PUF only points towards an external code list to be used.

Other times the code list to be used are a mix between values defined specifically for PUF and other external list/s.

Lastly, in some cases, *all* the values are defined solely for PUF.
